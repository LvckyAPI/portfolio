## What is this?

This is the source code for my website [https://schlenther.dev](https://schlenther.dev).  
The design of this portfolio is fully inspired by [@cnrad](https://github.com/cnrad/cnrad.dev).

## General information

Conrad's contact form uses Discord webhooks, while I use SMTP (email). The site notice comes
from [eRecht24](https://e-rech24.de).

While Conrad uses the classic page structure and inline css classes (tailwind), I mostly use SCSS with tailwind and the
app structure.
I have also added a cache for external API requests, as well as ratelimit and a honeypot.
My version does not pass on any client information like IP-Addresses to third parties and is therefore EU-DSGVO (GDPR)
and GER BDSG
compliant.

## Configuration

To configure the mailer, you need to edit the `.env` file in the root directory of the project.  
eRecht24 keys are stored there as well.
